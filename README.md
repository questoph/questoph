👋 

Hi there, I’m @questoph, a professor in Computational Linguistics at the University of Luxembourg.

👀 

I’m interested in combining computational methods of processing language with scholarly analysis to improve the social anchoring and cultural grounnding of language in NLP and Machine Learning.

🌱 

I’m currently building a new transversal research lab for cultural analysis and computational modeling [(CuCo Lab)](https://cucolab.uni.lu) at the Department of Humanities.

💞️ 

I’m looking to collaborate on NLP for small and lesser-resourced languages (such as Luxembourgish) and Computational Sociolinguistics projects in general.
